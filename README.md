## CI/CD — GitHub Actions

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) that automatically builds a signed release APK.

### Setup GitHub Secrets

Go to your repo → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add these 4 secrets:

| Secret Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEYSTORE_BASE64` | Your keystore file encoded as base64 |
| `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | Keystore store password |
| `KEY_ALIAS` | Key alias name |
| `KEY_PASSWORD` | Key password |

### How to encode your keystore as base64

```bash
# On Linux/Mac:
base64 -i your-keystore.jks | tr -d '\n'

# On Windows (PowerShell):
[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("your-keystore.jks"))
```

Copy the output and paste it as the `KEYSTORE_BASE64` secret.

### How it works

- **On every push to `main`** — Builds signed APK, uploads as artifact
- **On tag push (`v*`)** — Builds signed APK + creates a GitHub Release with the APK attached
- **Manual trigger** — Use "Run workflow" button in Actions tab

### Creating a release

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

This will trigger the workflow, build a signed `WASSaver-v1.0.0.apk`, and create a GitHub Release automatically.
